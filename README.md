# Setup and Review

This repo contains code for the password validator. The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

## Did you find the JavaScript Learning Tutor useful? If so, what about the tool made it useful? If not, why not?
> I do not know what you are referring to here. Maybe that explains why I struggled with this one. 


## Do you have any suggestions on how the JavaScript Learning Tutor might be improved?
> If I knew what that was then maybe I would.


## Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!).
> Yes I did. I got help from a random friend on discord. He gave me a temporary website I could use to compile while I fix my own downloads so that I could begin the assignment proper. Besides that just a lot of googling. 


## Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
> After I was actually able to compile the ts into js only an hour or two. A lot of time and frustration p until that point though


## On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment?
> 4 I propably messed it up since im not familiar with some of this stuff at all but I get the basic concept well enough. Technical issues were a pain in the butt though this time around


## Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better?
> Yes. Where and what I need to download in order to get a proper compiler is still fuzzy to me and I need to work that out still
